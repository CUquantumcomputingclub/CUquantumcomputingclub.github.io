### About
The Columbia Undergraduate Quantum Computing Club (CUQCC) is a group of undergraduate students who share the common interest of discussing and learning from different areas of research in quantum computing. While engaged in a seminar format, members of CUQCC will have an opportunity to talk with other like-minded people from all sorts of backgrounds. Everyone is welcomed!
