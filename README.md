### About
The Columbia Undergraduate Quantum Computing Club (CUQCC) is a group of undergraduate students who share the common interest of discussing and learning from different areas of research in quantum computing. While engaged in a seminar format, members of CUQCC will have an opportunity to talk with other like-minded people from all sorts of backgrounds. Everyone is welcomed! 

### Spring 2023 Schedule 

| Date | Speaker | Title | Abstract | 
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | 
| Feb 1st | Akshat Yaparla | Introduction Talk + what is Quantum Computing | An introduction into CUQCC and its seminar-stype format; then a discussion on Shor's Algorithm, the algorithm that showed quantum supremacy over classical machines | 
| Feb 8th | Manuel Paez | Quantum Key Distribution, CHSH game, and Quantum Cryptography | An introduction into the famous CHSH game, the BB84 protocol, and a proof of security for a Quantum Key Distribution (quantum cryptography) protocol that combines both concepts (Lecture based on Varizani, Vidick's 2019 paper) | 
| Feb 15th | Arjun Kudinoor | Entanglement For The Masses | A discussion on qubit spin, entanglement, and teleportation without the use of mathematical equations (conceptual) |
